Start:
	//This thread is completely optional. Its there to serve as automatic updating, but you might
	// want to run UpdateDiscord directly. This is useful for Unity as you can just call UpdateDiscord(); on a normal Update.
	// However! UpdateDiscord(); reads from the stream, so it is blocking! Unless I make it async
	Thread.Start(() => {

Initialize:
	//Combine this with start?
	

UpdateDiscord:
	if (!connection) return;		//This can be true as Initialize must be called first.
